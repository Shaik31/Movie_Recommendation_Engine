# Movie_Recommendation_Engine

For this project, I built a movie recommendation engine using cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences and historical ratings. By analyzing user ratings and applying similarity measures between movies, the system was able to recommend relevant movies to users. The use of cosine similarity allowed for an effective comparison of movie attributes and user preferences. This project demonstrated the power of collaborative filtering techniques in creating personalized user experiences. The recommendation engine can be adapted for various applications, including e-commerce and content platforms.
